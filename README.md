# LaterJoin
A simple yet EXTREMELY configurable EXILED Plugin that lets players respawn when rounds starts.

### Installation

%appdata% / Plugins
Copy reference to dependencies

### What does it do?
 When Start Round and some player join later the round starts
 if raound stats in less than 30 seconds , plugin will spawn the player, pretty simple! (It still needs [EXILED](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED "EXILED") to work!).

### Configuration
These are the variables that should be added to your 7777-config.yml. Or simply download/copy the [config-file example](https://github.com/ElecTwix/SimpleLaterJoin/Example/7777-config.yml)
| Variable  | Description | Default value |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Class_forrespawn | Changes the class for respawn when players join server late. (if you dont know Classes Go find discord #resources ) | `RoleType.ClassD` |
| respawn_duration | When Round Max time for later respawn **(Seconds)** | `30` |

### That'd be all
